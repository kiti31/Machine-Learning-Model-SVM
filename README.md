# Machine-Learning-Model-SVM
Machine Learning Model: SVM was created for the dataset QSAR biodegradation using python.

In this project we use Python to implement SVM on the QSAR biodegradation dataset. First, we import the important libraries and the chosen dataset. Next, we select the best features using the wrapper method and assign those features to x variable. Then we split the dataset into testing and training data before choosing the best kernels to build the model. We fitted the training dataset for all the kernels and predicted the data for both training dataset and testing dataset. The figures below show graphs of the test dataset against the predicted dataset.
